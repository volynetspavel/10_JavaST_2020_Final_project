Changing climate is altering the range of these animals because the snow is melting earlier and earlier in the season.

Sadly, wolverines are still trapped and killed for their fur and to reduce their numbers in certain areas. Their habit of eating anything they can get their paws on makes them considered a nuisance by most farmers.',
